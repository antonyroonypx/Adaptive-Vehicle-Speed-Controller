# Adaptive-Vehicle-Speed-Controller
Aim:
To enhance road safety in sensitive zones such as schools, hospitals, and accident-prone areas by automatically regulating a vehicle’s speed using RF-based zone detection and embedded control systems.

Key features:

➢ Detect restricted zones via RF signals.
➢ Reduce vehicle speed only if it exceeds the specified zone limit. 
➢ In non-restricted areas, manual speed control is enabled. 
➢ Real-time driver feedback using an LCD display and audio alerts. 

Main components:

➢ Arduino nano
➢ 433 MHz RF transmitter and Receiver
➢ Micro SD Card reader
➢ 2GB Micro SD Card
➢ ICs- LM386, L293D, HT12E, HT12D
➢ 16*2 LCD display
➢ 8 ohm, 0.5W Speaker
